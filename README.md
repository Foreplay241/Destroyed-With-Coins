# Destroyed-With-Coins
My submission for MetaBoy GameJam #2. You can catch anvils and coins. Just be careful, the anvils are really heavy.

I originally wanted to go with the top down example for a puzzle type, but after considering my own personal time restraints I thought the platformer example would be better for starting with.
I enjoy catching games and figured it would be my best chance, so I took it literally and figured I would destroy the MetaBoy system. What better way to destroy something than with anvils?
I didn't want to just destroy it and be done, so I used video game magical logicalities and had each anvil do somewhere between small and big damage.
I'm not sure why, but I felt like coins could heal a MetaBoy.

I hope you enjoy playing this as much as I enjoyed making it.
I've been working on a pretty big project and building something other than that has been a great break.


I've worked with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) many many months ago and it was fun working with it again.

I used this [font](https://www.fontspace.com/lcd-solid-font-f11346). I didn't dig too deep for a pixelated font.

I used [Wolfram Tones](https://tones.wolfram.com/generate/G8fukGwScIAo3HGlbn1QWRUjX27sD0y8LnjbTdbUqFntLjuSk) to generate a random "Blues" music style. First one sounded good to me.

[https://sfxr.me/](https://sfxr.me/) helped me make coin and anvil noises. (It did most of the work, I clicked a button until I liked the sound.)

[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) is a fantastic tool to make the coin and anvil.
